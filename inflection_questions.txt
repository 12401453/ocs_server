What is the ablaut-grade of the imperfects of class 14 verbs? (отврѣшти, отврѣсти etc.)

Do even the first-person imperatives of решти have zero-grade ablaut (rьkǫ, rьkěmъ)? What about the third-pl imperative (rekǫ or rьkǫ)? Diels' class I table suggests there are no 1st sg. or 3rd pl./dual. imperatives, but we know there is bǫdǫ 3rd pl. so it must've existed as a syntactic category

Uspenskij Sbornik пожьнѣте would suggest that the class 5 ablaut verbs are zero-grade in the imperativeъ but OCS (Psal., Mar. and Zogr.) has поженѣте
