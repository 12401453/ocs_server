The sentences_per_page value doesn't work properly and outputs only 29 sentences on the first page of a text (if the value is set to 30), which means that if you search for a word that occurs as the first word on page 2 of a text and then click on it, the retrieveTextFromSearch() function thinks you are on page 1 of the text and thus moves you to the wrong place (causing also the function to make the result-word glow to fail).
