It is tempting to assume zero-grade in the past pass. participle кръвенъ, but as Diels points out (p.56) /ъv/ comes from ECS *ū before vowels (*ū > *ŭv). The correctness of this interpretation is confirmed by past pass. part. шьвенъ from шити, which must have resulted from before the fronting of *ū > *ī after *j (*sjūti > *šīti, cf. Goth. siwan), when *sjū-ĕn- > *sjŭv-ĕn-. If these past pass. participles had zero-grade vocalisms , and /v/ was the result of hiatus-filling, we would expect **шьѥнъ, because the hiatus between front /ь/ and /e/ would hardly be filled by /v/ instead of /j/. Diels is, however, negligent (p.254) in not mentioning zero-grade ablaut as the underlying vocalism in the present-stem: Ru. крою, пью can only come fom *krъjǫ *pьjǫ, it's just that in the language underlying the majority of the OCS documents /ъj/, /ьj/ in these words had become /ij/, /yj/ respectively, and are thus spelt indistinguishably from /i, y/.",false,"","18",1},
